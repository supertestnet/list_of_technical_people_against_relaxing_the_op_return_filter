# List of technical people against relaxing the op_return filter

I am making this list because I talked to 3 different people recently who plan to remain on Bitcoin Core due to their impression that a "consensus of the devs" favors relaxing the op_return filters, and that only a handful of technical people dispute this consensus. I want to show that there is no such consensus.

By "technical people" I mean people who write or review code for protocols and apps that are (1) bitcoin itself (2) "on" bitcoin (e.g. wallets) (3) bitcoin adjacent (e.g. Liquid)
